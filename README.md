# odin-recipes
This is the first project withing The Odin Project cirriculum.
It is an html project where I create the foundations of a basic recipe website

I hope by the end of this project, I will demonstrate basic html skills such as
the utilization of writing paragraphs, headings, lists, links, and images
to build the foundations for this website
